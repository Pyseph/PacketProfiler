# PacketProfiler
Remote packet analyzer tool for Roblox

Packet Profiler is a plugin which allows you to accurately read remote data sent by different contexts. Unlike the vague and uninformative Stats windows which only show the current KB/s receive and send rates, this plugin allows you to accurately see packet data each frame, along with precise byte size information.
